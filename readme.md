This library offers an I/O interface for the EDU descritor file, along with a fully typed `UnitDescriptor` model.

This isn't supposed to be a CLI tool but rather a library to facilitate map/filter/reduce type operations on the `feral_export_descr_unit.txt` by leveraging typescript's amazingly robust and flexible type system and the pretty awesome IDE's intellisense experience that comes with it.
